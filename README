This is the first version of a simulation framework
for the application of formation flight in commercial
aviation. The simulation framework is written in Python.

It is part of a Msc thesis project at the faculty of
Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology.

Currently, this project is in its infantile stages and
a lot is going to change.

It is also my first attempt at managing an open-source
project. Please bear with me as I learn how to properly
communicate and document the code.
