General information:
==============================================
This a simulation framework for the application of formation flight in 
commercial aviation. The simulation framework is written in Python. It is 
part of an M.Sc. thesis project at the faculty of Aerospace Engineering 
at Delft University of Technology.

Requirements:
==============================================
- Numpy 1.5+
- Matplotlib 1.1+
- Basemap 1.0+

Usage:
==============================================
To run the simulation, perform the following command:

$ cat data/calibrated.tsv | ./run.py

Each time the simulation finishes a single run, the performance output 
variables are printed to stdout.

The script run.py is the main entry point of the simulation. It accepts 
the flight schedule as input over a Linux pipe. Numerous precalibrated run 
scripts are available in the runs directory. To select a different run, open
run.py and uncomment the import statement pertaining to the appropriate run.
